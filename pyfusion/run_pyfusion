# This is script to set up and check environment vars, and optionally run under ipython
# The design of this pyfusion  requires that the root directory be called
# pyfusion and PYTHONPATH should include the parent directory of pyfusion.
# So a program to set up env vars only needs to know the parent directory.
# ipython includes the current directory in its python path, so it is more
# tolerant of incorrect PYTHONPATH (and may hide bugs), so test this file
# by running python, not just ipython.
# This sourced file expects the parent directory of the pyfusion version
# being run, and defaults to the parent of the current dir if it contains 
# a directory pyfusion, otherwise it tries $HOME/python if it contains a pyfusion.
# MUST be sourced in bash shell.
